    Description : 
        SUM : Receives two Registers(Reg1 and Reg2) as operands and put result of sum in Reg3.
        GREATER : Receives two Registers(Reg1 and Reg2) as operands and put result of greater than comparison in Reg3.
        SUB : Receives two Registers(Reg1 and Reg2) as operands and put the result of subtraction in Reg3.
        EQUAL : Receives two Registers(Reg1 and Reg2) as operands and put the result of equal comparison in Reg3.

    Description : 
        SUM : Receives one Register(Reg1) and a constant as operands and put result of sum in Reg3.
        GREATER : Receives one Register(Reg1) and a constant as operands and put result of greater than comparison in Reg3.
        SUB : Receives one Register(Reg1) and a constant as operands and put the result of subtraction in Reg3.
        EQUAL : Receives one Register(Reg1) and a constant as operands and put the result of equal comparison in Reg3.
